  ->Clone the git branch using the git https link from the repository<br>
  ->Once the repository has been successfully cloned, go to the folder 'data' inside the repository.<br>
  ->You will find a reviews.json.zip file, we had to zip this JSON because its exceeding the size limit of 100 MB allowed for git upload.<br>
  ->Unzip this file to get the reviews.json in the 'data/' folder.<br>
  ->Start the local server of your preference or using WebStorm to run the index.html to get the site running in your local.<br>
  
<b>Note :</b> If you are accessing the site online, due to the large volume of data, the initial load is a bit slow and also due to the limited bandwidth capacity of our trial domain. Please, please, please wait for a moment till the initial data loads to be able to access the visualization.
